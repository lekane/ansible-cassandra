# Create/configure Cassandra cluster & OpsCenter
# ==============================================
#
# To create node for new empty cluster: 
# ansible-playbook -i <inventory> --extra-vars="init_server=true empty_cluster=true" cassandra.yml 
#
# To create node for existing cluster: 
# ansible-playbook -i <inventory> --extra-vars="init_server=true" cassandra.yml 
#
# To replace node in existing cluster: 
# ansible-playbook -i <inventory> --extra-vars="init_server=true replace_dead_server=true replace_address=<address>" cassandra.yml 
#
# To update/upgrade nodes in existing cluster:
# ansible-playbook -i <inventory> cassandra.yml 
#
# To update/upgrade node extra config (backup, cron etc) without configuring & restarting main Cassandra service in existing cluster:
# ansible-playbook -i <inventory> --extra-vars="restart_cassandra=false" cassandra.yml 
#
# To target specific node/nodes, add -l node1[:node2][:nodeN]
